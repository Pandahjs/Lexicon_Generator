Proposal Overview  
---
The focus of this research project is a focus on Procedural Content Generation.  
Specifically, we aim to study the methodologies of PCG so that a tool can be built  
to produce symbol sets for use in games. These symbols would be pictographic,  
taking a collection of inputs from a game designer (a Library) and converting  
those concepts into this newly generated language.  
While not PCG, the idea for the symbols is drawn from the linguistic puzzle game  
*Chants of Sennaar* and specifically from an analysis of the pictographs in game  
\<Spoiler Warning\> (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3037327250).

Demo Overview
---
We propose building the tool from our research into PCG methods.  
This would be done in the Godot Engine framework so we get the maximal amount of  
iteration time (so we're wasting time writing our own 2D render pipeline), whilst  
building in a framework that is flexible enough for strange applications. 

The demo program would take it a small dictionary of words, sorted into conceptual groups.  
These groups, like `Object, Location, Living Thing, Good, Evil` The generated symbols for  
these groups would then be composed alongside a generated unique symbol for each word to  
produce a meaningful pictogram in this new "language."  


Research Applicability
---
We wish to generalize the process of making the language symbol set into a set of PCG processes  
that can produce meaningfully related symbols whose purpose is to enhance the world building  
capacity of Narrative and Systems designers. In addition to the theoretical future uses, a number  
of media past and present produce small or vast languages to increase their engagement.  
Tolkien, a linguistics professor by trade, wrote at a minimum two different versions of elvish for  
his collected works. Lucas' *Star Wars* has Aurebesh, an alphabet to transcribe Galatic Basic.  
In Games it is less common, although was used to great effect in the game *Outer Wilds* with it's  
Nomai Inscriptions that you translate in game. And of course the inspirational game for this propsal,  
*Chants of Sennaar* is a wonderful example of the kinds of things this too is designed to achive.  
In terms of another potential use case; a designer could use the tool to generate a set of symbols  
not for a digital game, but for an adventure in a pen and paper RPG whose driving mystery is found by  
translating these symbols in an engagement experience like *Outer Wilds* or *Chants of Sennaar.*
